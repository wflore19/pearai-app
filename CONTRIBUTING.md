Welcome to the PearAI app! PearAI is a fork of VSCode (and Continue), with most of the functionality in `extension/pearai-submodule`. Follow the guide below to contribute effectively and have fun while doing it! üòÑ

## üöÄ Getting Started

After cloning and building the repo, check out our [issues list](https://github.com/trypear/pearai-app/issues). For first-time contributors, issues labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/trypear/pearai-app/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22) are great starting points. If you're contributing significant changes, or if the issue is already assigned to a specific milestone, please discuss with the assignee first on [Discord](https://discord.gg/7QMraJUsQt).

## üåü Contributing Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fork and Clone

1. Go to the [pearai-app repository](https://github.com/trypear/pearai-app.git).
2. Click on the "Fork" button at the top right of the page to create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.
3. Once forked, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pearai-app.git
   ```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Environment

First time setup:

- **macOS and Linux**:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/pearai/setup-environment.sh
  ```
- **Windows**:
  ```bat
  .\scripts\pearai/setup-environment.ps1
  ```

To rebuild the app after initial setup:

- **macOS and Linux**:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/pearai/install-dependencies.sh
  ```
- **Windows**:
  ```bat
  yarn
  ```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the App

#### PearAI is split into two parts. pearai-app and pearai-submodule.

- [pearai-app](https://github.com/trypear/pearai-app/): VSCode fork and parent repository for PearAI. Most contributions will NOT end up here.

- [./extensions/pearai-submodule](https://github.com/trypear/pearai-submodule): Nearly all of PearAI's functionality, packaged as a built-in VSCode/PearAI extension. It is a fork of Continue, and is a git submodule of pearai-app. Most contributions will end up here!

#### A) PearAI Submodule / Extension

1. Open the directory `extensions/pearai-submodule` in PearAI or VSCode.
2. Make edits.
3. In VSCode/PearAI, open the command palette (`cmd/ctrl+shift+p`) and select `Tasks: Run Task` and then select `install-and-build`.
4. Start debugging:
   - Switch to Run and Debug view.
   - Select `Extension (VS Code)` from the drop-down.
   - Hit the play button.
   - This will start the extension in debug mode and open a new VSCode/PearAI window with the submodule installed (with your local changes).

#### B) PearAI App

1. Run `yarn watch` in a terminal - wait for it to compile everything (around 2 mins), it then shows "finished compiling", keep it running.
2. For watching extension - open another terminal and run:
   ```bash
   cd extensions/pearai-submodule/extensions/vscode
   yarn tsc-watch
   ```
3. Open another terminal to run the app:

   - **macOS and Linux**:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/code.sh
     ```
   - **Windows**:

     - If first time installing, you must run:

       ```bat
       .\scripts\code.bat
       ```

     - On consecutive runs, we recommend downloading Git Bash, and running:

       ```bash
       ./scripts/code.sh
       ```

       \*Note: this is due to the fact that the symlinking must be performed within the `code.bat` file on Windows on the first run. But on consecutive runs the symlink will already be created, so you can use the faster script which is `code.sh`

## üíª Automated Testing

Run the unit tests directly from a terminal by running `./scripts/test.sh` from the `pearai-app` folder (`scripts	est` on Windows).

We also have automated UI tests. The [smoke test README](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/main/test/smoke/README.md) has all the details.

## üêõ Debugging UI

### Using the Chrome Developer Tools

Run the `Developer: Toggle Developer Tools` command from the Command Palette in your development instance of VS Code to launch the Chrome tools.

### VS Code for the Web

Extensions and UI run in the browser.

üëâ Besides yarn watch also run yarn watch-web to build the web bits for the built-in extensions.

macOS and Linux

```
./scripts/code-web.sh
```

Windows

```
.\scripts\code-web.bat
```

### Code Server Web

UI in the browser, extensions run in code server (NodeJS):

macOS and Linux

```
./scripts/code-server.sh --launch
```

Windows

```
.\scripts\code-server.bat --launch
```

## üîç Linting

We use [eslint](https://eslint.org/) for linting our sources. You can run eslint across the sources by calling `yarn eslint` from a terminal or command prompt. You can also run `yarn eslint` as a VS Code task by pressing `Ctrl+P` (`CMD+P` on macOS) and entering `task eslint`.

To lint the source as you make changes you can install the [eslint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).

## üåø Work Branches

Even if you have push rights on the `trypear/pearai-app` repository, you should create a personal fork and create feature branches (`yourname/branch-name`, e.g. `pan/open-chat-shortcut`) there when you need them. This keeps the main repository clean and your personal workflow cruft out of sight.

## üìú Pull Requests

Before we can accept a pull request from you, you'll need to sign a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://github.com/trypear/pearai-app/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributor-license-agreement). It is an automated process and you only need to do it once.

To enable us to quickly review and accept your pull requests, always create one pull request per issue and [link the issue in the pull request](https://github.com/blog/957-introducing-issue-mentions). Never merge multiple requests in one unless they have the same root cause. Be sure to follow our [Coding Guidelines](https://github.com/trypear/pearai-app/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-guidelines) and keep code changes as small as possible. Avoid pure formatting changes to code that has not been modified...

## üêõ Creating Issues

Before you submit an issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/trypear/pearai/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.
Use the provided issue template when creating a new issue. Fill in the template with as much detail as possible. The more detail you provide, the more likely that someone can help you.
Alternatively, you can use Pear to create a ticket for the problem first. Simply describe the issue or feature request, and Pear will create a ticket for it. This can help you understand the problem better and guide you in manually solving it.
You can also directly ping the maintainers or admins in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/7QMraJUsQt).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Packaging

This section outlines how to package the app for a new release/distribution. This process is a bit manual currently.

### Step 1: Package PearAI App

PearAI can be packaged for the following platforms: `win32-ia32 | win32-x64 | darwin-x64 | darwin-arm64 | linux-ia32 | linux-x64 | linux-arm`.

These `gulp` tasks are available:

- `vscode-[platform]`: Builds a packaged version for `[platform]`.
- `vscode-[platform]-min`: Builds a packaged and minified version for `[platform]`.

1. If you have not already, run `./scripts/pearai/setup-environment.[sh,ps1]`.
2. If already ran that upon your first install, run `./scripts/pearai/install-dependencies.[sh,ps1]`.
3. Run `yarn gulp vscode-[platform]`. For example `yarn gulp vscode-linux-x64`.

This will generate the new PearAI app and takes around 1 hour.

### Step 2: Package PearAI Extension

`pearai-submodule` also needs to be packaged and integrated into the overall PearAI app.

1. `cd` into `extensions/pearai-submodule`.
2. Run `./scripts/install-dependencies.sh`.
3. `cd` into `extensions/vscode` (Full path is now `extensions/pearai-submodule/extensions/vscode/`).
4. Run `npm run package`.
5. This will create the `.vsix` extension within `extensions/pearai-submodule/extensions/vscode/build`.
6. Right-click the `.vsix` in VSCode or PearAI and select `Install vsix as Extension`.

### Step 3: Integrate the Extension

1. Copy the contents of the generated `extensions` folder into the `extensions/` folder of the packaged PearAI App.
2. Delete any existing `pearai-submodule` folder in the `extensions/` folder of the packaged PearAI app.
3. Double-click your overall PearAI app, and the extension should be built-in.

### Step 4: Signing and Turn Into Installer

Admin must sign the app on certain OS's, like MacOS. Admin should follow these [manuals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hZahz2UNrtZOgHZkquqNO7Jfoe0Pd0OA7Ud16ts_AKs).
